🌤️ Weather Dashboard

A web-based Weather Dashboard that displays real-time weather information for a searched city using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app fetches live weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind) from a public weather API and presents it in a clean, responsive interface.

🚀 Features

✔️ Search weather for any city
✔️ Displays current weather conditions
✔️ Shows key weather metrics like temperature, humidity, wind
✔️ Clean and responsive UI for desktop and mobile
✔️ Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ([similar dashboards use APIs like OpenWeather Map])
